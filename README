The par files have been prepared from version B of the IPTA DR2, which is hosted here: https://gitlab.com/IPTA/DR2/-/tree/master/release/VersionB

The par file for each pulsar is based on the TCB (TEMPO2) par files in the DR2 database

The directory hosts a file named sample.par which has each and every parameter annotated with its purpose and explanation as far as I could :)

Each par file has three sections:
1. Timing model parameters: The basic timing parameters like position, period period derivative DM and the respective reference epochs

2. Binary model parameters: Binary type and the binary parameters for pulsars in binary systems. Absent for isolated MSPs

3. Clock and other parameters: The clock correction, reference and barycentric conversion methods
